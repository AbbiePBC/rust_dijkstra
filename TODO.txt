## TODOs

# Easy things to fix
[x] in rust, mod should be used instead of include!().
[x] probably not worth providing names always for format!().
[x] &str should be used instead of String for read-only strings.
[x] print path if doesn't exist
[x] error out if incorrect number of nodes is provided
[x] use more specific naming rather than get_node()
[x] test_shorter_initial_route_gets_updated is testing 2 things; use the expected graph instead of the parsed one.
[x] rename reverse_sort() lol

# Design comments
[x] group the parsing functions under a module, and put that under the graph module,
and have a single "parse" function that generates a graph from a string.
Or maybe a constructor Graph::new_from_string(&str) -> Result<Graph>.
[x] functions like create_new_edge would fit quite nicely as a constructor (static method).
 For example, `impl Edge { pub fn new(...) -> Edge { ... }}`.
[ ] the graph design has redundancy constraint (and Edge e has to be contained in `graph.edges[e.start]`).
Possibly use Vec<Vec<Weight>> and create functions that return full Edges (with start and end) when needed,
or builder functions that ask for what the client wants and hide the internal structure.
For example, `graph.create_new_edge(start, end, weight)` doesn't require the client to know the internal structure nor comply with the consistency constraint.
[x] In general, code should have modular functions that allow you to test the same without bothering about the full binary,
capturing stdout, or comparing human-readable strings. Something like `assert_eq!(dijkstra_from_file("src/test/uk.txt"), OK(("Glasgow", "Edinburgh", 45)));`,
or using a custom enum instead of Result would convey the different error cases more clearly.
[ ] improve readability of how dijkstra and add_to_frontier functions work.
[x] if possible, remove cyclic dependency of parse_input and construct_graph
//edit: now, main->find_path, construct_graph, parse_input; find_path->construct_graph, parse_input; construct_graph->parse_input.
[ ] dijkstra_from_file(<path>) would be nice

# Bug fix!
[x] After fixing the bug in which the total dist from the start node was added rather than of an edge
the results are different
Route travelled: Cardiff->Bristol->Birmingham->London, with distance 243 (previously Cardiff->Bristol->London 158)
Route travelled: York->Manchester->Birmingham, with distance 146 (previously York->Birmingham 129)
[ ] There is a bug where the path is overwritten so we lose all knowledge of previous paths that may have been present
This can be fixed by storing in nodes_visited all possible paths to nodes, and choosing which path is selected with a bool
Route travelled: London->Birmingham->Manchester->York->Newcastle->Edinburgh->Inverness, with distance 604 (London->York->Newcastle->Edinburgh->Inverness 541) / 573?
^ this one still fails.
194 + 82 + 107 + 158
111 + 81 + 214 + 167 (London->Birmingham->Manchester->Glasgow->Inverness,)

[] practise using git to rename/squash old commits (e.g. `mend` after a failed amend)
